## Three Layer Archtecture
1. __Controller Layer__: handle request from routes, decide render a view or call a service.
1. __Service Layer__: perform business logic, CRUD or call another service.
1. __Data Access Layer__

Why 3 layers ? Scalibility and Modularity, as app grows, you can still hold the complexity.

Donâ€™t put business logic inside controller layer, as it will become messy when write unit test, you have to mock every reqest and response. use service layer for your business logic.
